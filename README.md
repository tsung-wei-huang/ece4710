# CS/ECE 4710 Computer Engineering Sr. Project

This course is for students with major status who are seniors within one year of graduation. In this course the student completes the design of an engineering project that is selected with approval of the instructor according to the specifications defined in the proposal document from 3992. The fully functional project is demonstrated at the end of the semester.

There are several major goals for this project, which will prepare the students for industry or graduate work:

+ Identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems.
+ Design a system, component, process, or software package to meet a specification.
+ Function on a multi-disciplinary team in various roles.

Each team will complete the development of the project proposed in 3992. The team is responsible for project management, product development, parts procurement, documentation, and reporting. Various resources are supplied to help the students in their project. Students have space and equipment in the Senior Hardware Lab. This will generally be the location for hardware and software development and team meetings with the instructor.
